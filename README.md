# Intelligent-Minutes-of-Meeting

Online meetings for business decision making and team discussions are currently the need of the hour given the conditions of working from home. Keeping track of the discussions and taking notes of the meeting while managing online communication methodologies is extremely difficult and time consuming. Very often, it is observed that important points are missed in online meetings due to lack of methods for maintaining accountability


## Proposed Solution

To solve the above problem, we are developing an AI enabled tool which can extract text from the meeting audio and can efficiently summarise this text using extractive as well as abstractive methods without any human intervention. A structured pdf of the notes can be made available for the participants of the meeting after it is completed so that the users can completely focus on the discussion. This tool can also be used in education to obtain summarised notes  of online lectures
